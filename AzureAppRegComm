Here are the steps to create an Azure Application Registration for this:

1. **Create an Azure Application**

   - Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - On the left-hand side, click on "Azure Active Directory".
   - Then, navigate to "App registrations" and click on "New registration".
   - Enter a "Name" for the application, and leave the "Redirect URI" blank for now, then click on "Register".

2. **Set up API Permissions**

   - Once the app is registered, go to "API permissions" in the left-hand menu.
   - Click on "Add a permission" -> "Microsoft Graph" -> "Delegated permissions".
   - Look for `Presence.Read`, `Presence.Read.All` permissions and add them. 
   - You might also need `User.Read` permission if you don't already have it.

3. **Grant Admin Consent**

   - After adding the permissions, you'll need to grant admin consent for your organization.
   - Click on the "Grant admin consent for {Your Organization}" button. You'll need to be an administrator or have administrator approval for this.

4. **Create a Client Secret**

   - Go to "Certificates & secrets" in the left-hand menu.
   - Click on "New client secret", enter a description and an expiry period, and then click on "Add".
   - Once you've created the secret, it will be displayed. Make sure you copy this and store it securely; you won't be able to see it again later.

5. **Get your Application (client) ID and Tenant ID**

   - Go to "Overview" in the left-hand menu.
   - Here you can see the Application (client) ID and the Directory (tenant) ID. You'll need these later, so make sure you note them down.

Now, you've registered your Azure Application and set it up to get Teams user presence information. 

Remember that to access the presence information, you need to get an access token first, which you get by sending a POST request to the token endpoint (`https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token`) with a payload that includes your `client_id`, `client_secret`, `scope` as 'https://graph.microsoft.com/.default', and `grant_type` as 'client_credentials'. 

Then, you use the access token to make a GET request to the Graph API's get presence endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{userId}/presence`).

Remember, you will only be able to get presence information for users who are in the same tenant as the app and who have not blocked the app. Users can block apps by signing into Teams and going to Settings -> Privacy -> Manage apps, then clicking on the app and selecting "Block".
